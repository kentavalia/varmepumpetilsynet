# Varmepumpetilsynet - Heat Pump Service Platform

## Overview

Varmepumpetilsynet is a comprehensive web application that connects heat pump customers with certified installers in Norway. The platform provides subscription-based services for heat pump maintenance tracking, installer management, and administrative oversight. It's built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing Vite as the build tool for optimal development experience and performance. The UI is crafted with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design system.

Key frontend decisions:
- **React with TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with hot module replacement for efficient development
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI**: Pre-built, accessible components reducing development time
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for consistent styling
- **Wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing (3kb vs React Router's larger bundle)
- **TanStack React Query**: Robust data fetching and caching solution

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. It implements a layered architecture separating concerns between routing, business logic, and data access.

Key backend decisions:
- **Express.js**: Mature, flexible web framework for Node.js
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with excellent TypeScript integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database suitable for complex business logic
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for scalable cloud deployment

### Authentication System
Uses custom authentication system with bcrypt password hashing and session-based storage in PostgreSQL.

Key features:
- Username/password authentication with bcrypt hashing
- Session-based login state management
- Password reset functionality with email tokens
- Role-based access control (customer, installer, admin)
- Admin account management capabilities

Rationale: Custom authentication provides full control over user management, allowing admin oversight of installer accounts and password management without external dependencies.

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Core user information with role-based access (customer, installer, admin)
- **Customers**: Customer-specific profile data and subscription status
- **Installers**: Company information, certifications, and approval status
- **Heat Pumps**: Equipment tracking with service history
- **Service Areas**: Geographic coverage for installer services
- **Sessions**: Secure session storage for authentication

### API Routes
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` - User login/logout, session management
- **Customers**: `/api/customers` - Customer registration and profile management
- **Installers**: `/api/installers` - Installer registration, approval, and management
- **Heat Pumps**: `/api/heat-pumps` - Equipment registration and service tracking
- **Contacts**: `/api/contacts` - Customer-installer communication
- **Payments**: `/api/payments` - Stripe integration for subscriptions

### User Roles & Access Control
- **Customers**: Can register heat pumps, view service history, contact installers
- **Installers**: Can manage service areas, view customer requests, update service records
- **Admins**: Full system access, installer approval, subscription management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate via Replit OIDC, sessions stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Role-based Routing**: Frontend routes users to appropriate portals based on their role
3. **Data Fetching**: React Query manages API calls with automatic caching and invalidation
4. **Form Submission**: Zod validation on both frontend and backend ensures data integrity
5. **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic updates with React Query provide responsive user experience

## External Dependencies

### Payment Processing
- **Stripe**: Handles subscription payments and billing
- Integration includes customer creation, subscription management, and webhook handling
- Environment variables required: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- Connection via `@neondatabase/serverless` for edge-compatible database access
- Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Geographic Data
- Norwegian county and municipality data hardcoded in the frontend
- Used for installer service area management and customer location tracking

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with hot module replacement
- Express server with tsx for TypeScript execution
- Database migrations via Drizzle Kit
- Replit integration with cartographer plugin for enhanced debugging

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: esbuild creates bundled Node.js executable
- Database: Drizzle manages schema migrations
- Environment: Designed for deployment on platforms supporting Node.js with PostgreSQL

### Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe API key for payments
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Stripe publishable key for frontend
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret for session encryption
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Allowed domains for OIDC
- `ISSUER_URL`: OIDC issuer URL (defaults to Replit)

The architecture prioritizes type safety, developer experience, and scalability while maintaining simplicity in deployment and maintenance.
